Description
===========
This cookbook configures the networking required for OpenStack, specifically for the compute service nova.

Requirements
============

Chef 0.10.0 or higher required (for Chef environment use)

Platform
--------

* CentOS >= 6.3
* Ubuntu >= 12.04

Cookbooks
---------

The following cookbooks are dependencies:

* mysql
* nova
* osops-utils
* sysctl

Attributes
==========

Nova Networking
----
* `nova["network"]["provider"]` - The networking provider to use with nova. By default this is set to nova, but can be changed to quantum.
* `nova["networks"]` - An array of networks to be assigned to instances on creation

### Example
    [
        {
            "label" => "public",
            "ipv4_cidr" => "192.168.100.0/24",
            "bridge" => "br100",
            "bridge_dev" => "eth2",
            "dns1" => "8.8.8.8",
            "dns2" => "8.8.4.4"
        },
        {
            "label" => "private",
            "ipv4_cidr" => "192.168.200.0/24",
            "bridge" => "br200",
            "bridge_dev" => "eth3",
            "dns1" => "8.8.8.8",
            "dns2" => "8.8.4.4"
        }
    ]

* `nova["network"]["public_interface"]` - Interface for public IPs
* `nova["network"]["dmz_cidr"]` - A dmz range that should be accepted
* `nova["network"]["network_manager"]` - Class name for network manager
* `nova["network"]["dhcp_domain"]` - Domain to use for building hostnames
* `nova["network"]["force_dhcp_release"]` - Send DHCP release on instance termination?
* `nova["network"]["send_arp_for_ha"]` - Send gratuitous ARPs for HA setup?
* `nova["network"]["auto_assign_floating_ip"]` - Auto-assigning floating ip to VM?
* `nova["network"]["floating_pool_name"]` - if creating a floating ip pool, what to name it
* `nova["network"]["multi_host"]` - Use multi-host mode?
* `nova["network"]["platform"]` - Hash of platform specific package/service names and options

Quantum Networking
----
* `quantum["network_api_class"]` - used in nova.conf.the quantum api driver class. 
* `quantum["auth_strategy"]` - used in nova.conf. the authentication strategy to use, by default this is set to keystone
* `quantum["libvirt_vif_driver"]`- used in nova.conf. the virtual interface driver, by default nova.virt.libvirt.vif.LibvirtHybridOVSBridgeDriver
* `quantum["linuxnet_interface_driver"]` - used in nova.conf. the linux net interface driver, by default nova.network.linux_net.LinuxOVSInterfaceDriver
* `quantum["firewall_driver"]` - used in nova.conf. the firewall driver to use, by default nova.virt.libvirt.firewall.IptablesFirewallDriver
* `quantum["services"]["api"]["scheme"]` - scheme for service (http/https)
* `quantum["services"]["api"]["network"]` - `osops_networks` network name which service operates on
* `quantum["services"]["api"]["port"]` - port service binds to
* `quantum["services"]["api"]["path"]` - service URI
* `quantum["db"]["name"]` - database name
* `quantum["db"]["username"]` - database username
* `quantum["db"]["service_tenant_name"]` - defaults to `service`
* `quantum["db"]["service_user"]` - defaults to `quantum`
* `quantum["db"]["service_role"]` - defaults to `admin`
* `quantum["debug"]` - default log level is INFO
* `quantum["verbose"]` - default log level is INFO
* `quantum["overlap_ips"]` - Enable or disable overlapping IPs for subnets. MUST be set to False if Quantum is being used in conjunction with nova security groups and/or metadata service.
* `quantum["use_namespaces"]` - should correspond to overlap_ips used for dhcp agent and l3 agent.
* `quantum["plugin"]` - select the quantum backend driver plugin to use, currently only supports openvswitch
* `quantum["l3"]["router_id"]` - once a default network and router are created update the environment with the router uuid
* `quantum["l3"]["gateway_external_net_id"]` - once a default network and router are created update the environment with the external network uuid
* `quantum["ovs"]["network_type"]` - used to select the network type, currently only supports gre tunnels.
* `quantum["ovs"]["tunneling"]` - must be true if using GRE
* `quantum["ovs"]["tunnel_ranges"]` - Enumerating ranges of GRE tunnel ID
* `quantum["ovs"]["tunnel_bridge"]` - the tunnel interface name
* `quantum["ovs"]["external_bridge"]` - the external interface name
* `quantum["ovs"]["external_interface"]` - an available interface on the node that will access the external network

Usage
=====
The recipes nova-controller and nova-compute are used in their corresponding roles single-controller and single-compute. The role quantum-network-manager has been added to indicate a node that is running l3_agent, dhcp_agent, and ovs_plugin.

Networks LWRP
=============
The nova-network cookbook has a resource and provider named networks. This LWRP provides the ability to create a fixed network, delete a fixed network, create a floating ip network, and delete a floating ip network.

Usage
-----

### Create a fixed network
    nova_network_networks "Create #{label}" do
        label label
        multi_host T|F
        fixed_range cidr
        bridge host bridge name (i.e. br100)
        bridge_int host bridge interface (i.e. eth0)
        dns1 primary dns server ip or name
        dns2 secondary dns server ip or name
        action :create_fixed
    end

### Delete a fixed_network
    nova_network_networks "Delete #{label}" do
        fixed_range cidr
        action :delete_fixed
    end

### Create a floating ip network
    nova_network_networks "Create floating ip network #{cidr}" do
        pool floating_pool_name
        float_range cidr
        action :create_floating
    end

### Delete a floating ip network
    nova_network_networks "Delete floating ip network #{cidr}" do
        float_range cidr
        action :delete_floating
    end
